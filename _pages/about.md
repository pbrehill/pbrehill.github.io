I am a PhD candidate at POLIS: The Centre for Social Research at the Australian National University. My thesis is currently being examined.

The focus of my research is on the causal forest and policy evaluation. The causal forest is a causal machine learning method for finding drivers of treatment effect heterogeneity â€” how a given treatment affects different people differently. It is useful because standard approaches rely on pre-specifying hypotheses and then testing them while the causal forest allows for a statistically valid, data-driven, flexible way to explore heterogeneity. The causal forest, if used well, lets evaluators find unintended consequences of programs, take full advantage of high-dimensional administrative datasets, and move beyond testing for heterogeneity only in the 'usual suspects' like age and gender. My work is focused on building new tools to allow policy-makers to extract insights from a causal forest and on creating an impact evaluation methodology that accounts for the strengths and weaknesses of the method.

Outside of my doctoral work, I am currently working in the Australian Centre for Evaluation in the Australian Treasury and at the RMIT Department of Economics, Finance, and Marketing. In both these roles I work on social policy research using quasi-experimental or experimental designs, often with large, linked, administrative datasets. Prior to this, my background was as a data scientist / quantitative researcher working for government and not-for-profits.
