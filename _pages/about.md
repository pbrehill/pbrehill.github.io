I am a PhD candidate at POLIS: The Centre for Social Research at the Australian National University. My thesis is currently being examined.

The focus of my research is on building tools and methodology to integrate causal forests into public policy impact evaluation. The causal forest is a causal machine learning method for finding drivers of treatment effect heterogeneity â€” how a given treatment affects different people differently. It is useful because standard approaches rely on pre-specifying hypotheses and then testing them, while the causal forest allows for a statistically valid, data-driven, flexible way to explore heterogeneity. The causal forest, if used well, lets evaluators search for heterogeneity across an arbitrarily large number of variables, including across interactions between them. This helps to make sure unintended consequences of a program will not be missed.

Outside of my doctoral work, I work at the Australian Centre for Evaluation in the Australian Treasury and the RMIT Department of Economics, Finance, and Marketing. In both these roles I work on social policy research using quasi-experimental or experimental designs, often with large, linked, administrative datasets. Prior to this, my background was as a data scientist / quantitative researcher working for government and not-for-profits organisations.
